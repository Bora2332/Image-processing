# Image Processing with Multiple Models

This project is a collection of image processing techniques using multiple models and methods. It aims to demonstrate and compare different approaches for solving image-related tasks such as classification, filtering, detection, and transformation.

## 📌 Features

- Multiple image processing models (e.g., CNNs, traditional filters, segmentation models)
- Modular structure for easy integration and testing
- Preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- Evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- Designed for experimentation and extension

## 🧠 Models Included

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, MobileNet)
- Classical image processing techniques (e.g., Sobel, Canny, Gaussian blur)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
